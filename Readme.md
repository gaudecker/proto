# Proto

Project tools for GNU Emacs

## Introduction

Proto is a collection of functions for extracting metadata from, browsing, and
manipulating projects and workspaces.

A **project** is a directory on a filesystem, like
`/home/richard/projects/emacs`.  Projects usually contain source files and other
miscellaneous files.

A **workspace** is a directory that contains projects. Following the previous
example, `/home/richard/projects` could be a workspace.  Proto considers every
directory inside a workspace a project, this means that we will never have to
save Proto-specific project files on the filesystem.
